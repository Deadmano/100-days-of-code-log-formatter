# #100DaysOfCodeLog Formatter

This is a personal project of mine which I decided to do during my own #100DaysOfCode journey to help build upon the skills I had acquired during the challenge as well as for a way for me to give back to the wonderful community!

This web application allows you to fill in your log via an easy to use form and have it formatted into GitHub markdown which means you can easily just paste it into your GitHub log without having to worry about the appropriate markdown, handling links properly, etc!

The tool has the ability to handle multiple work references (links) by simply clicking the _Add Another Link_ button, and it will only output links to your log if both the Title and URL sections are filled.
