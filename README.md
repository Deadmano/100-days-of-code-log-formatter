This is a personal project of mine which I decided to do during my #100DaysOfCode journey to help build upon the skills I had acquired during the challenge as well as for a way for me to give back to the wonderful community!

This web application allows you to fill in your log via an easy to use form and have it formatted into GitHub markdown which means you can easily paste it into your GitHub log without having to worry about the appropriate markdown, since it is all taken care for you!

## Usage

You can either grab a copy from the [latest releases](https://github.com/Deadmano/100-days-of-code-log-formatter/releases) or view it as a web app directly from your device at https://deadmano.github.io/100-days-of-code-log-formatter/

Once you have loaded the app you will need to fill in the fields on the form.


| Required Fields | Optional Fields |
| :-------------: |:---------------:|
| Day             | Hours           |
| Date            | Minutes         |
| Progress        | Title           |
| Thoughts        | URL             |

The _Hours_ and _Minutes_ refer to how long you have spent on a given day you are logging and is completely optional. Should you require more links for your work references, you can interact with the _Add Another Link_ button to add an additional set.

Once the form has been filled, simply interact with the _Format Input_ button and your output will appear in the box below.

There is a handy _Copy Output_ button which you can use to copy the output directly to your clipboard.

From there, simply paste the output into your GitHub log and you're good to go! Safe travels on your journey!
